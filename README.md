# Boilerplate

My personal collection of things I end up copying around a lot. There is a
README in each subdirectory explaining how and when something is useful.

In case someone else finds these handy, the repository is provided under the MIT
license and I do not consider any individual snippet here a "substantial portion
of the software" and don't expect anyone to carry that license over. (A star on
the repo would be nice though.)
